This repository contains the full pipeline for generating numerical simulations to particle-laden flows as used in the research paper 'A comparative study of dynamic models for gravity-driven particle-laden flows', accepted for publication at Applied Mathematical Letters, 2025 (see also https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23561).

The original code was written using Jupyter Notebook and can be found in particle-laden-flow/notebook-code.


This code was developed by Wing Pok Lee, Jonathan Woo, Luke Triplett, and Yifan Gu with assistance from Hong Kiat Tan.
