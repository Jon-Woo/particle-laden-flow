This repository contains the full pipeline for generating numerical simulations to particle-laden flows as used in the research paper 'A comparative study of dynamic models for gravity-driven particle-laden flows', accepted for publication at Applied Mathematics Letters, 2025 (see also https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23561).

The original code was written using Jupyter Notebook and can be found in particle-laden-flow/notebook-code. To use the code with regular Python, see particle-laden-flow/code.

The pipeline contains three parts:
1) Generating numerical solutions of the conservation law fluxes
2) Solving the conservation law systems
3) Plotting numerical simulations of fluid fronts against experimental data

This code was developed by Wing Pok Lee, Jonathan Woo, Luke Triplett, and Yifan Gu with assistance from Hong Kiat Tan.
