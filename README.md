This repository contains the code for the research paper 'A comparative study of dynamic models for gravity-driven particle-laden flows', accepted for publication at Applied Mathematical Letters, 2025. The code is responsible for solving the equilibrium model ODE systems as well as the conservation law PDE systems for both the diffusive flux and suspension balance models.
