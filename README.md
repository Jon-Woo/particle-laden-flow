This repository contains the code for the research paper 'A comparative study of dynamic models for gravity-driven particle-laden flows', accepted for publication at Applied Mathematical Letters, 2025 (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23561). The code is responsible for solving the equilibrium model ODE systems as well as the conservation law PDE systems for both the diffusive flux and suspension balance models.

The original code was written using Jupyter Notebook and can be found in particle-laden-flow/notebook-code
